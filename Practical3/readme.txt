Exercise from Practical 3 - PageRank algorithm.

To compile

g++-7 Practical3.Exercise2.PageRank.cpp -o Practical3.Exercise2.PageRank

To Run

./Practical3.Exercise2.PageRank

Please include the corresponding files in the same folder as the compiled file in order for it to work as expected.

Files to be used:
wiki.txt --> File with edges
pagename.txt --> File with name of websites based on their index

Notes:

The code has been developed using c++ and the focus was to improve its performance, it has been developed using the edge iteration method in order to compute B[j].

After this process has been applied the normalization has been applied and all the tests have been run with 20 iterations.
